# Introduction

For a while now, I've always wanted to create a terminal like website that showcased my portfolio and had some fun and nifty commands to output various stuff! Even now, I don't think it's perfect, but it's a project
I'm gonna spend some time on.

This is a terminal-based website where you can enter various commands, which are available at the moment of course (but some are secret 😏, find them out!).

### Instructions
#### Basic Usage

You can `git clone` the repo and open the `index.html` file to experience the terminal.

To get a basic list of commands, you can enter `help` in the terminal to see what commands are available (of course, not all of them 😗).

### Bucket List

1. Add some themes.
2. Add some cool and interactive commands.

When any one of them gets completed, it will be striked out.
